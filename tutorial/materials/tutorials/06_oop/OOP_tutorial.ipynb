    "### __1. Programming Paradigms__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots for programming languages that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented. Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized. Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be handled. There are so many of them, because certain paradigms are better suited for certain types of problems.\n",
    "You can't \"build\" anything with a paradigm. They're more like a set of ideals and guidelines that many people have agreed on, followed, and expanded upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are languages that have been built with a certain paradigm in mind and have features that facilitate that kind of programming more than others (Haskel and functional programming is a good example).\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are also \"multi-paradigm\" languages, meaning you can adapt your code to fit a certain paradigm or another (like Python for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __1.1 Imperative Programming Languages__\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative programming consists of sets of detailed instructions that are given to the computer to execute in a given order. It's called \"imperative\" because as programmers we dictate exactly what the computer has to do, in a very specific way.\n",
    "Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates, step by step.\n",
    "It works by changing the program state through assignment statements. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Procedural programming** is a derivation of imperative programming, adding to it the feature of functions (also known as \"procedures\" or \"subroutines\"). In procedural programming, the user is encouraged to subdivide the program execution into functions, as a way of improving modularity and organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-oriented programming**, or short **OOP**, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of organizing code and structuring programs such that properties and behaviors are bundled into a collection of **classes** and **objects** which are meant for communication. \n",
    "It is a software development methodology that focuses on representing real-world entities and their interactions in a structured, modular, and efficient way. This is great for building frameworks and tools, which makes the code maintainable and reusable. The smallest and basic entity is the object and all kind of computation is performed on the objects only. More emphasis is on data rather procedure. It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __1.2 Declarative Programming Languages__\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science the declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. It may simplify writing parallel programs. The focus is on what needs to be done rather how it should be done by emphasizing on what code is actually doing. It just declares the result we want rather how it has be produced. This is the only difference between imperative (how to do) and declarative (what to do) programming paradigms. Getting into deeper we would see logic, functional and database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functional Programming: has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principle of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their implementation. Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- logical programming: an abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism. \n",
    "In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem. The execution of the program is very much like proof of mathematical statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database/Data driven programming: is based on data and its movement. Program statements are defined by data rather than hard-coding a series of steps. A database program is the heart of a business information system and provides file creation, data entry, update, query and reporting functions. There are several programming languages that are developed mostly for database application. For example SQL. It is applied to streams of structured data, for filtering, transforming, aggregating (such as computing statistics), or calling other programs. So it has its own wide application. (More of this will be covered in the last Tutorial)\n"

    "\n",
    " **Objects** are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well. An object may have a pyhsical or a conceptual existence. \n",

    "**Abstraction** can be thought of as a natural extension of **encapsulation**. It is a process of **hiding** the **implementation details** from the user, only the **functionality** will be provided to the user. In object-oriented design, programs are often extremely large. And separate objects communicate with each other a lot. So maintaining a large codebase like this for years - with changes along the way - is difficult. Abstraction is a concept aiming to ease this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it. This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant for the other objects. Instead of how it does it, the user will have the information on what it does.\n"

The thing we don’t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew a fresh cup of delicious coffee. We don’t need to know the ideal temperature of the water or the amount of ground coffee we need to use. In the same way, a Python class Human would just use the making coffe method of the class CoffeeMachine, but it would not need to know about all the details of the implementation of the CoffeeMachine class.\n"
