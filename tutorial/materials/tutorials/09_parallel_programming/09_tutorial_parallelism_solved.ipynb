A good example for this are Input/Output (IO) tasks where the different processes are (mostly) independent of each other. If you want to retrieve the content of a web page for example you will have to query the server for the information you need (the input). The server will then return the answer or information (the output) to you. While you are waiting for the server to respond and give you the output your machine is basically having a grand ol' time chilling and relaxing since there is nothing else to do than wait. Now, we can't have that of course! Every free minute needs to be invested into work, work, WORK...!<br>\n",
    "So... Instead of just letting our machine lounge around, we tell it to send another query to another web page while it is waiting for the first web page to answer. And while it is still waiting we tell it to send another query, and another, and another... until our machine wishes there were something like machine rights or a labor union for computers.<br>\n",
    "I hope you kinda get the point. We are not doing this stuff at the very same time but rather one step after the other. Since it only takes our machine a split second to send out a new query, though, we might get the impression that everything is working in parallel. Once the answers of the web pages are returned, they are for example stored and then printed.<br>\n",

You decide on a movie and once you go back to your fist tab, it's finished loading and your good to go!"

Since the threads are not running at the same time but rather each after the other (t1, t2, t3, t1, t2, t3,...) we do not see an improved run time.

    "Multiple cores, capable of running multiple threads, are running at the exactly same time.<br>\n",
    "This happens so fast, though, that you might easily assume that they are run in parallel and well, yes, they are! Good examples for this are processes that are a bit more taxing (or/and) can be split among multiple cores. Think of running a classification model for example. The goal is to classify a huge amount of data according to some rule set and the data can easily be broken into smaller subsets.<br>\n",
    "You simply provide multiple cores with the same instructions but slightly different data aka different subsets of your original data. Then each core starts classifying their respective subset of the data and once done you can collect the results from all cores and put them together. The beautiful part about this is, that you can also provide different instructions to different cores while providing all of your cores with the same data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:<br>\n",
    "You have to calculators and the motor skills to use them both at the exact same time.<br>\n",
    "In one scenario you have a list of values (your data) and you want to perform some mathematical operation on those values. In order to halve the time needed to perform this operation split the list of values in two and use one calculator to run the operations on the first halve and the other calculator to run the operations on the second halve.<br>\n",
    "In the other scenario you have a list of values (your data) and you want to perform two different mathematical operations, A and B, on those values. So, naturally, you use one calculator to run operation A on all values and the other calculator to run operation B on all values. Thereby halving the time needed to complete the task."
