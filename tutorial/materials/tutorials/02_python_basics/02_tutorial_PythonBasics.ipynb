    "\n",
    "In general conversion to \"larger\" data types can be done without any loss of information.\n",
    "Conversions to \"smaller\" data types will usually lead to a loss of information (i.e. precision). If you, for example, need to convert a floating point number to an integer, the decimal places simply get cut off (= loss of precision). \n",
    "The general type hierarch is:\n",
    "- byte $\\subset$ short = char $\\subset$ int $\\subset$ long \n",
    "- float $\\subset$ double \n",
    "\n",
    "Such type castings can either be done *implicitly* or *explicitly*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implicit type casting**:\n",
    "    - Assume you have a float ``x = 6.4`` and an integer ``y = 2``. If you cant to devide them ``z = x/y`` this works without problems and gives you ``z = 3.2`` (a float). \n",
    "- **Explicit type casting:**\n",
    "    - If you have a integer ``x = 2`` and a string ``y = \"Hello u \"``, the following won't work: ``z = y + x``. This is because Python does not know how to combine an integer and a string. To make it work, wou would need to do ``z = y + str(x)`` = \"Hello u 2\". This way, the 2 is first converted into a string and then the two strings can get concartinated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To check the type of a variable in Python, simply use ``type(<Variable>)``.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are ordered collections of items, sepataed by a comma. These items can be of different variable type and lists have variable lengths. \n",
    "You can even have lists as items within other lists (= nested lists). Since lists are ordered you access the elements within the list using their index-position in squared brackets. Note that the index starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, lists are mutable. This means you can initialize a list with a certain content and later delete or modify the content/parts of the content. Later on you will get to know other data types where this is not possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Basic Operations*:\n",
    "- Generate an empty list called l: ``l = []``\n",
    "- Adding a single value to the list: ``l.append(<Value>)``\n",
    "- Insert a value at a specific position x: ``l.insert(x, <Value>)``\n",
    "- Remove the value from a certain position: ``l.pop(<IndexPos>)``\n",
    "- Remove a certain value: ``l.remove(<Value>)``\n",
    "    - Removes the first occurance of the specified value (in case, multiple are present) \n",
    "- Concatenating two lists: ``<list> + <list>``\n",
    "- Extract or slice lists: ``<List>[<IndexPos>]`` or ``<List>[<Slice>]``\n",
    "    - For Example: ``l = [2, 1, 4, 3]``\n",
    "    - ``l[1]`` = 1\n",
    "    - ``l[-1]`` = 3\n",
    "    - ``l[:3]`` = [2, 1, 4]\n",
    "    - ``l[1:3]`` = [1, 4]\n",
    "    - ``l[-2:]`` = [4, 3]\n",
    "    - ``l[:-2]`` = [2, 1]\n",
    "- Change a value at a certain position: ``l[0] = 99`` results in ``l`` being [99, 1, 4, 3]\n",
    "- Nested List: ``nl = [[1, \"Hello\"], [3.4, True, 8]]``\n",
    "    - Note that the lists within lists may be of different length.\n",
    "    - If you need to index them, ``nl[0]`` = [1, \"Hello\"] and ``nl[1]`` = [3.4, True, 8]. Therefore, if you want to access the 3.4 you need to type: ``nl[1][0]``\n",
    "- Sort lists: ``l.sort()`` = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "- Reverse lists: ``l.reverse()`` = [3, 4, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be linear or non-linear. A linear list means, that the elements are ordered sequentially and traversed each after another (linear). In a non-linear list, one elements can be connected to multiple other ones, or none at all. The connections themself reflect a specific relation. Such non-linear list are for example trees or graphs. But we will learn more about them later on this semester. Stay tuned ;)\n"

    "Lambda Functions are small, anonymous  functions that can take multiple inputs, but only has one expression.\n",
    "They are anonymous, because the functions are unnamed, not like in ``def my_function(<Input>)``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax is:\n",
    "- ``lambda <Input>: <Expression>``\n",
    "\n",
    "You could for example write a function to always add 1 to the input x:\n",
    "- ``lambda x: x + 1``\n",
    "- if you surround this anonymous function in parenthesis and add an input in brackets behind, you immediately apply the function, i.e. ``(lambda x: x + 1)(2)`` = ``lambda 2 : 2 + 1 `` = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions can also take multiple arguments,. These are listed without parenthesis, separated by comma. When callsing the function, however, the inputs have to be declared in brackets.\n",
    "- ``lambda a, b : a * b``\n",
    "- ``(lambda a, b : a * b)(5, 6)`` = ``lambda 5, 6: 5 * 6`` = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of lambda function is better shown, when they are nested within other function, as small, unnamed helper functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use then together with the ``map()`` function. ``map(<Operation>, <List>)`` applies a certain operation to every item of a list.\n",
    "- ``list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(11)))``, due to ``map`` we apply the lambda function with input x to every item of the ``range(11)``elements. This means, every integer 0, 1, ..., 10 is once the x in the lambda function, being raised to the power of two. Finally ``list()`` makes a list out of the result. This could equivalently be done using list comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "Combined with ``filter()`` you could filter items from a list, based on a lambda function\n",
    "- ``list(filter(lambda x: x < 50, range(100)))`` returns a list of all numbers between 0 and 99, that are smaller than 50 (this is what the lambda function did).\n",
