    "Sometimes when working with webscraping or text processing (to name but a few topics where regexes come in handy) we would like to extract some specific text from a larger corpus of text data. Imagine for example a data set of posts where you would like to extract all email addresses in an automated fashion without having to go through each post yourself.<br>\n",
    "Since we cannot just type: 'get me all email addresses', and python does the rest, we need to come up with a more sophisticated solution. That's were regexes come into play. Using regexes we can instruct our machine to look for certain patterns inside our data (e.g. the data set of posts) and extract all passages that match these patterns. Looking at our data set for example we could try to find a pattern that includes all email addresses but nothing else and pass that as an instruction to our machine.<br>\n",
    "Since such patterns can be quite complex and coming up with a solution yourselves can be taxing let's first go over some basics and easy examples to get you started."
