# ICSS Private Material Repository

Contains all teaching materials, lecture slides, assignments and tutorials used in the ICSS program for the academic years 2024 and 2025 (in progress).

The repository is structured into several core sections:

- The `lecture/` folder includes PowerPoint slides for the lectures, organized by year (in 2025, it's currently just a placeholder so that it's displayed in github). 

- The `tutorial/assignments/` directory contains the assignments from 2024 (in 2025 once again just placeholders...)

- The `tutorials/materials/` directory holds the terminal scripts for github from Andri (`github/`), info documents like Git and terminal cheatsheets (`info_documents/`) and last years tutorial materials (`tutorials/`). In 2025 the Dashbord materials are included. **Remarks on the dashbords materials:** use `00_tutorial_dashboards` to get to know the workflow of streamlit. This notebook is intended to work as the "teaching" material in the tutorial during the semester, so check for readability, typos, etc. If you want you can also check the `.py` files (i.e. screenshots in the 00_tutorial_dashboards). `tweet_annotation_app.py` might work as a sample solution of the app in the upcoming third assignment and is the dashbord version of my OOP app from last year. `titanic_app_solutions.py` is intended as the sample solution for the interactive tutorial part in the notebook.

- The `Computer Tutorial` directory contains the materials needed for the planned Computer Tutorials
