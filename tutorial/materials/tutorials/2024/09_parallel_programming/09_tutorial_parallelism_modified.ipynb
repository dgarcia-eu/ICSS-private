A good example for this are Input/Output (IO) tasks where the different processes are (mostly) independent of each other. If you want to retrieve the content of a web page for example you will have to query the server for the information you need (the input). The server will then return the answer or information (the output) to you. While you are waiting for the server to respond and give you the output your machine is basically having a grand ol' time chilling and relaxing since there is nothing else to do than wait. Now, we can't have that of course! Every free minute needs to be invested into work, work, WORK...!<br>\n",
    "So... Instead of just letting our machine lounge around, we tell it to send another query to another web page while it is waiting for the first web page to answer. And while it is still waiting we tell it to send another query, and another, and another... until our machine wishes there were something like machine rights or a labor union for computers.<br>\n",
    "I hope you kinda get the point. We are not doing this stuff at the very same time but rather one step after the other. Since it only takes our machine a split second to send out a new query, though, we might get the impression that everything is working in parallel. Once the answers of the web pages are returned, they are for example stored and then printed.<br>\n",

You decide on a movie and once you go back to your fist tab, it's finished loading and your good to go!"
