# ICSS Private Material Repository

Contains all teaching materials, lecture slides, assignments and tutorials used in the ICSS program for the academic years 2024 and 2025 (in progress).

The repository is structured into several core sections:

- The `lecture/` folder includes PowerPoint slides for the lectures, organized by year (in 2025, it's currently just a placeholder so that it's displayed in github). 

- The `tutorial/assignments/` directory contains the assignments from 2024 (in 2025 once again just placeholders...)

- The `tutorials/materials/` directory holds the terminal scripts for github from Andri (`github/`), info documents like Git and terminal cheatsheets (`info_documents/`) and last years tutorial materials (`tutorials/`). In 2025 the Dashbord materials are included.
