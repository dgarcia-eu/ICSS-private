    "**What is an Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It is a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous, and computationally effective instructions that, when executed, produce a certain desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, an algorithm is like a recipe or a set of directions that guides someone (or, in the case of computers, something) through a series of steps to accomplish a particular goal. Algorithms are fundamental in computer science and programming, as they form the basis for solving problems, processing data, and performing various computational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the ICSS lecture you probably have encountered quite a few algorithms already. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are crucial in solving computational problems efficiently, and understanding their design and analysis is fundamental for any programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some Important Categories of Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search** − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sort** − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert** − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Update** − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of an Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Input** − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Feasibility** − Should be feasible with the available resources.\n",

    "#### __1.2 Way and Workflow of Writing Algorithms__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Understanding the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly Define the Problem Statement: \n",
    "    -  Start by thoroughly understanding the problem you need to solve. Clearly define the input, output, and any constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify Input and Output Requirements:\n",
    "    Determine the format and type of input data your algorithm will receive and the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Designing the Algorithm**\n",
    "- Choose Algorithmic Approach:\n",
    "   - Select an appropriate algorithmic approach based on the nature of the problem. Consider whether a greedy approach, dynamic programming, or divide and conquer is most suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pseudocode:\n",
    "   - Write pseudocode as a high-level description of your algorithm. Pseudocode serves as a roadmap before diving into actual code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Illustrate with Simple Example:\n",
    "   - Take a simple example of the problem and walk through how your algorithm would solve it step by step. This helps in understanding and clarifying the algorithm's logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Testing and Debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategies for Testing Algorithms:\n",
    "   - Develop test cases to verify the correctness of your algorithm. Test with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it handles all scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging Code:\n",
    "   - Identify and fix any issues that arise during testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**D. Simplify and Optimize**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refine Algorithm for Simplicity:\n",
    "   - Review your code for unnecessary complexity. Simplify the algorithm while maintaining correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize for Efficiency:\n",
    "   - Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm. Identify opportunities for optimization without sacrificing correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterative Process:\n",
    "   - Writing and optimizing code is an iterative process. Go back and forth between simplifying, optimizing, and testing until you are satisfied with the performance and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**E. Process May Also Include Pseudocode?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, Include Pseudocode:\n",
    "   - Pseudocode is a valuable step in the algorithm design process. It helps in clarifying the logic before diving into code implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translate Algorithm from Pseudocode into Code:\n",
    "   - Consider translating your pseudocode directly into code, ensuring a smooth transition from your design to the actual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write Code and Debug:\n",
    "  - Follow the steps mentioned earlier for writing code and debugging. Pseudocode serves as a guide during the implementation phase.\n",

    "**Computational complexity** is a field from computer science which analyzes algorithms based on the amount resources required for running it. The amount of required resources varies based on the input size, so the complexity is generally expressed as a function of n, where n is the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that when analyzing an algorithm we can consider the **time complexity** and **space complexity**. \n",

    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",

Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform.*\n",

    "\n",
    "- **average-case:** this is the average complexity of solving the problem. This complexity is defined with respect to the distribution of the values in the input data. Maybe this is not the best example but, based on our sample, we could say that the average-case would be when we’re searching for some value in the “middle” of the list, for example, the value 2.\n",
