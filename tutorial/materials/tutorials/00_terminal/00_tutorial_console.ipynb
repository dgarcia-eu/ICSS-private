If you do this there is no room for mistaking your input since there must be no more than one root, `C:`, and the terminal knows this. As soon as you type `C:/...`it knows that you are starting at the root and therefore follows your specified absolute path. If you tried the same without including the root directory `C:`in your path, for example `Users/Me/Now/someFile.txt` the terminal would not know where to start looking. While it might be easy to see for us humans what is meant by this input considering this simple toy example it is impossible for the computer to deduce your intentions.
