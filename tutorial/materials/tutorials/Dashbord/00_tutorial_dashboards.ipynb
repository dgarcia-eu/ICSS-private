    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Session States\n",

    "### 4.3 Simulating Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In classic front-end frameworks like Dash or Shiny, developers define **callbacks** that are triggered when a specific input changes ‚Äî e.g.,‚Äúwhen the user selects a column, update the plot‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit does not use explicit callbacks. Instead, it follows a **top-to-bottom execution model** and reactivity is built using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conditional Python logic  \n",
    "2. Stateful variables via `st.session_state`  \n",
    "3. The `on_change` parameter for widgets that need reaction logic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs consider a typical problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want users to first choose a type of analysis: Categorical or Numerical  \n",
    "- Based on that choice, we want to update the **available columns** in a `selectbox()`  \n",
    "- But `selectbox()` widgets are rendered **before** the `radio()` button‚Äôs change is processed\n",
    "\n",
    "Without an explicit callback or deferred logic, the `selectbox()` won't update dynamically based on the user‚Äôs selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Combine `session_state` with `on_change`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we simulate a **callback** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `st.radio(..., on_change=choose_reaction)` to call a function when the selection changes  \n",
    "- Inside that function, updating `st.session_state[\"type\"]`\n",
    "- Then using that value to determine which columns are shown in the `selectbox()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def choose_reaction():\n",
    "    if st.session_state.column_type:\n",
    "        st.session_state.type = st.session_state.column_type\n",

    "## 5. Interactive Tutorial Part\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll gradually build a Streamlit dashboard based on the titanic dataset.\n",
    "Step by step, you will:\n",
    "- display and filter data\n",
    "- add interactivity via widgets\n",
    "- manage the dashboard's state with st.session_state\n",
    "- simulate callback-like behavior with on_click handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "These are essential skills you will later apply when building your own tweet classification app in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the built-in `titanic` dataset from Seaborn, which contains data of passengers that were embarged on the Titanic, when it sunk in 1912.\n",
    "You‚Äôll extend the same script throughout this tutorial. Unless stated otherwise, assume that all previous code remains in place and should be updated or expanded ‚Äî not deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Basic Setup\n",
    "- Set a title for your app\n",
    "- Show the first 5 rows of the dataset using `st.write()` or `st.table()`. Try both to see the difference!\n",
    "- Display a bar chart showing the distribution of passenger ages. Include a `st.subheader()` as the title for the bar chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Filter by Passenger Sex\n",
    "- Add a selectbox **before** the bar chart to let the user choose between \"male\" and \"female\"\n",
    "- Filter the dataset accordingly and update the bar chart to reflect the selection (don't forget to update the subheader aswell)\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Random Passenger Annotation\n",
    "We'll try to guess the destiny of passengers based on several characteristics of the respective guest. For that do the following:\n",
    "- Randomly select and display one passenger from the filtered dataset (in your code, no need to display that in the dashboard)\n",
    "- Show their name (if available), age, class and sex.\n",
    "- Create buttons to classify the passenger as survived/not survived. Use the `st.columns()` and `with` functions to arrange them next to each other.\n",
    "- When you press the botton a `st.success()` or respectively `st.error()`, it should state you categorized the passenger in the respective category.\n",
    "\n",
    "These buttons (right now) should not have any functionality. As streamlit is executing the code top-to-bottom the displayed passenger will change anyway after pressing the button, as the script is executed once again from the beginning and another passenger will get sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d) Track Annotations using st.session_state\n",
    "- Before you set up you buttons, initialize `st.session_state.count = 0` once.\n",
    "- Each time a label button is pressed, increment the counter.\n",
    "- Display the current number of annotations using `st.write()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Guard initialization with `if \"count\" not in st.session_state`\n",
    "\n",
    "### e) Move Annotation Logic into a Function \n",
    "- Also set up a `st.session_state.annotations` and initialize it with an empty list\n",
    "- Replace your previous button logic by defining a function `classify(label)` that updates the annotation count and stores the selected passenger's information: age, class, sex, your label (label) and the true label from the dataset (true_label).\n",
    "- Then update your buttons to use `on_click=classify` and pass the respective label using args=(...).\n",
    "- You can remove the old button logic ‚Äî this function replaces it. **Hint:** you need an additional \",\" after your label e.g. `args=(\"survived\",)`\n",
    "- Store a list of annotations in `st.session_state.annotations`\n",
    "\n",
    "### f) Reporting Accuracy\n",
    "Now that you are storing both your own label (label) and the correct label (true_label) for each annotated passenger, let‚Äôs calculate how well you‚Äôre doing.\n",
    "- If annotations exist, convert them into a `pandas.DataFrame`.\n",
    "- Add a new column correct that compares the label with the true_label.\n",
    "- Calculate the accuracy as the share of correctly classified passengers.\n",
    "- Display the result using `st.write()` or a bar chart that shows the number of correct vs. incorrect classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove or comment out earlier print statements such as `st.success(...)` that were used for temporary feedback, since now accuracy is tracked more formally."
